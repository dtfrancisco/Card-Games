# Card-Games
Card Games is a package designed to make creating simple versions of card games easily. I've created a simple version of blackjack which is functional, but has many small options that need to be implemented. I also started creating Uno with this package, and I may implement more card games such as Texas Hold 'Em and Hearts in the future.
